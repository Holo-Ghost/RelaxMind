# RelaxMind
My part of the project for my college class. I am making it public for my classmates to be able to see.

It is an extremely lengthy piece of code, probably the longest I have ever constructed, so it is probably going to be a pain to navigate unfortunately.
I apologize in advance for that.

It consists mostly of switch statements and menus, and of course will most likely have some edits once it is combined with my groupmates' parts of the project.
